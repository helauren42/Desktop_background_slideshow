# gnome_wallpaper_slider

This program is developed as a desktop background slideshow for gnome. I had installed a lovely wallpaper slideshow gnome extension on my fedora 41, it was working well except that my laptop's key input would bug everytime the image was updated. It was a big disappointment for me not to be able to flex my slideshow desktop background to my friends and aquaintances, I really wanted this feature so I decided to make my own background slideshow program! It works very well on my machine, and I'm happy I built it, because having my own background slideshow now allows me to flex extra hard on my friends! I know how cool it is to have a background slideshow so I'm working on an official gnome release so that more people can flex on their friends too <3.

The command "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri" accepts all format types even when I tested custom types it worked, but for more convenient usage of this program I have limited the available image types to ("jpeg", "jpg", "png", "gif", "bmp", "tiff", "tif", "webp", "ico", "heif", "heic", "raw"), so that your .txt .json and other file types in your selected image repository can be ignored
