when --set-time is executed the instance of run.py needs to be determined and launched back in order to update the delay time
and background image, the alternative is to constantly check if the path or images or set_time has been updated using the 
manager.py which is inefficient

so manager.py needs start and stop commands
pid is stored in .data.json
